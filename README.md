# multievolvent-go
An implementation of the algorithm to solve constrained global optimizations problems exploiting multiple Peano-type curves.
The algorithm is described in paper R. G. Strongin [Algorithms for multi-extremal mathematical programming problems employing the set of joint space-filling curves][paper], Journal of Global Optimization 2(4), 1992.

Also an alternative method of generation different Peano-type curves was implemented. The method is based on rotations of the original curve. For details see paper: K. A. Barkalov, V. V. Ryabov, S. V. Sidorov [Parallel computations in global optimization problems][paper2],  2009 (in Russian)
